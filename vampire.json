(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)\nOh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill\nCan't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will\nWent for me and not her\n'Cause girls your age know better\nSee Olivia Rodrigo LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire\n[Bridge]\n(Ah)\nYou said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?\nYou can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart\nI tried to help you out, now I know that I can't\n'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand\n\n[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire36Embed"
